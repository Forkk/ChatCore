Chat Core
=========

Chat Core is an IRC bouncer which aims to unify your IRC experience by
supporting every possible IRC bouncer protocol. This means you can connect to a
Chat Core bouncer with a Quassel client, a standard IRC client (the same way
you'd connect to other bouncers such as ZNC), and potentially even more in the
future.
